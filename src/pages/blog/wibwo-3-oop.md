I mentioned last week that I was watching a course on LinkedIn about [object-oriented design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3/). I finished my first watch through and have begun to re-watch it, this time taking notes. The first watch without any other obligations allows me to really listen to what is being taught and understand. Now on my second watch I know what was valuable to me, I just need to go through and pull it out so I can review it for myself. Of course, application is always the most important step, so I'm motivated to get into a new project that gives me the opportunity to use all of these skills the course has taught.

I'm still reading *The Pragmatic Programmer*. Once I'm finished with that I'll probably move on to *Clean Code*. As I get better with object-oriented design/programming, I'll continue to learn design patterns and read the *Design Patterns* book in addition to that. There is a course on LinkedIn that gives a good introduction to design patterns taught by the people who wrote the book *Head First Design Patterns*, which I sometimes see recommended over the original *Design Patterns* book.

So by next week I'd like to have finished taking notes on my object-oriented course, and begun work on a project. See you next week!
